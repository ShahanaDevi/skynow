## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with JavaScript

- **State Management**: React Context API
- **HTTP Client**: Axios & Fetch API
- **Weather API**: OpenWeatherMap
- **Location Services**: Browser Geolocation API

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd weather-auth-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your OpenWeatherMap API key
# Get your free API key from https://openweathermap.org/api
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Optional: enable charts and interactive maps

The Analytics page includes optional interactive charts and a Leaflet map. To enable them install the packages below inside the `frontend` folder and rebuild the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install recharts
# for the interactive Leaflet map
npm install react-leaflet leaflet
```

On Windows builds can take longer. If you're building inside Docker, add `node_modules`, `build`, and other large folders to `.dockerignore` and consider using WSL2 for improved I/O performance.

### Weather API Setup

1. Visit [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and sign up for a free account
2. Get your API key from the dashboard
3. Add it to your `.env` file:
```env
REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Authentication Flow

### 1. Registration
- User fills out registration form
- Form validation ensures data integrity
- JWT token is generated and stored
- User is redirected to dashboard

### 2. Login
- User enters email and password
- Credentials are validated
- JWT token is generated and stored
- User is redirected to dashboard

### 3. Password Reset
- User requests password reset via email
- Reset link is sent (simulated in mock service)
- User clicks link and enters new password
- Password is updated and user can login

### 4. Protected Routes
- Routes are protected by authentication status
- Unauthenticated users are redirected to login
- JWT tokens are automatically included in API requests

## Mock Service

The application includes a mock authentication service for development and testing:

- **Test Users**:
  - Email: `john@example.com`, Password: `password123`
  - Email: `jane@example.com`, Password: `password123`

- **Features**:
  - Simulates API delays
  - JWT token generation
  - User registration and login
  - Password reset functionality

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Weather API Configuration
REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key_here

# Authentication API Configuration (if using real backend)
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
REACT_APP_USE_MOCK_SERVICE=true
```

### Required API Keys

- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Get your free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
  - Sign up for a free account
  - Navigate to API keys section
  - Copy your API key and add it to `.env` file

## Backend Integration

To connect to a real backend:

1. Set `REACT_APP_USE_MOCK_SERVICE=false` in your `.env` file
2. Update `REACT_APP_API_URL` to point to your backend
3. Ensure your backend implements the following endpoints:

```
POST /api/auth/register
POST /api/auth/login
GET  /api/auth/verify
POST /api/auth/forgot-password
POST /api/auth/reset-password
GET  /api/auth/me
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Runs the app in development mode
- `npm test` - Launches the test runner
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production
- `npm run eject` - Ejects from Create React App

## Customization

### Styling
- Modify `tailwind.config.js` to customize the design system
- Update colors, fonts, and spacing as needed
- All components use Tailwind utility classes

### Components
- All components are modular and reusable
- Easy to customize and extend
- TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety

### Authentication
- JWT token management is handled automatically
- Easy to integrate with different backend systems
- Configurable token expiration and refresh

## Security Considerations

- JWT tokens are stored in localStorage (consider httpOnly cookies for production)
- Passwords are not stored in the frontend
- All API requests include proper error handling
- Form validation prevents malicious input
- Protected routes prevent unauthorized access
